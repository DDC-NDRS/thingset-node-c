# ThingSet node library in C

[ThingSet](https://thingset.io) is a transport-agnostic and self-explanatory remote API for embedded devices and humans.

This library implements the node side in C. It was re-implemented almost from scratch to overcome shortcomings of the previous [ThingSet device library](https://github.com/ThingSet/thingset-device-library).

The main purpose is to provide a module for Zephyr RTOS, but the library can also be used in other embedded C environments.

## Contributors
